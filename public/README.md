# Background Music Setup

The pet simulator now supports automatic background music playback!

## Quick Setup (3 steps):

1. **Download free music** from: https://incompetech.com/ (Kevin MacLeod)
   - Search for "Ambient" or "Peaceful" tracks
   - Example: "Floating Cities", "Peaceful Piano", "Relaxing Music"

2. **Save as MP3**:
   - Download any chill/ambient track
   - Convert to MP3 if needed
   - Keep file size under 10MB

3. **Place in this folder**:
   - Rename file to: `background-music.mp3`
   - Replace the existing `background-music.mp3.txt` file
   - Music will auto-play when you enter the pet care screen!

## How Auto-Play Works:

- ✅ **Automatic**: Starts when entering pet care screen
- ✅ **Interactive**: Plays on first click/keyboard press if needed
- ✅ **Looping**: Music repeats continuously
- ✅ **Volume**: Set to comfortable background level (30%)
- ✅ **Stop**: Automatically stops when leaving pet care

## Alternative Sources:

- **Free Music Archive**: https://freemusicarchive.org/ (search "ambient")
- **YouTube Audio Library**: Search "royalty free ambient music"
- **OpenGameArt**: https://opengameart.org/art-search-advanced?keys=&field_art_type_tid%5B%5D=13

## Troubleshooting:

- **Not playing?** Check browser console for error messages
- **File not found?** Make sure it's named exactly `background-music.mp3`
- **Browser blocks?** Try clicking anywhere first, then music should start

The music creates a relaxing atmosphere for pet care activities! 🎵

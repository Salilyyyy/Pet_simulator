PLACEHOLDER FILE - Replace with actual MP3

This is a placeholder file. To add background music:

1. Download chill/ambient music from open source sources (see README.md)
2. Rename the file to "background-music.mp3"
3. Replace this .txt file with the actual .mp3 file

Recommended sources:
- Incompetech (Kevin MacLeod): https://incompetech.com/
- Free Music Archive: https://freemusicarchive.org/
- OpenGameArt: https://opengameart.org/

Look for tracks with "ambient", "chill", "relaxing", or "peaceful" in the title.

🎵 BACKGROUND MUSIC NOW WORKS! 🎵

**Great news**: The pet simulator now generates chill ambient music automatically!

✅ **No setup required** - music plays when you enter the pet care screen
✅ **Piano-like melody** with soft ambient pads
✅ **Auto-starts** on first interaction if needed

**Optional**: Add your own music file to override the auto-generated music:

1. Visit: https://incompetech.com/
2. Download any "Ambient" or "Peaceful" track (MP3)
3. Rename to: background-music.mp3
4. Replace this .txt file with the .mp3 file

Your custom music will then play instead of the generated music!

🎵 Enjoy the relaxing background atmosphere! 🎵

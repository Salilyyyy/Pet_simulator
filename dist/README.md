# Background Music Setup

The pet simulator now supports automatic background music playback!

## 🎵 Music Plays Automatically!

**Good news**: Background music now works immediately! The game generates chill ambient music automatically, or you can add your own music file.

## Option 1: Use Auto-Generated Music (Works Now!)

- ✅ **No setup required** - chill ambient music plays automatically
- ✅ **Piano-like melody** with soft ambient pads
- ✅ **Relaxing atmosphere** for pet care

## Option 2: Add Your Own Music (Optional)

1. **Download free music** from: https://incompetech.com/ (Kevin MacLeod)
   - Search for "Ambient" or "Peaceful" tracks
   - Example: "Floating Cities", "Peaceful Piano", "Relaxing Music"

2. **Save as MP3**:
   - Download any chill/ambient track
   - Convert to MP3 if needed
   - Keep file size under 10MB

3. **Place in this folder**:
   - Rename file to: `background-music.mp3`
   - Replace the existing `background-music.mp3.txt` file
   - Your music will override the auto-generated music!

## How Auto-Play Works:

- ✅ **Automatic**: Starts when entering pet care screen
- ✅ **Interactive**: Plays on first click/keyboard press if needed
- ✅ **Looping**: Music repeats continuously
- ✅ **Volume**: Set to comfortable background level (30%)
- ✅ **Stop**: Automatically stops when leaving pet care

- **"🎵 Chill background music started!"** - Auto-generated music is playing
- **"📁 No music file found, generating chill background music..."** - Fallback activated

Enjoy the relaxing background music while caring for your pets! 🎵✨
